# Traffic Prediction and Vehicle Detection Using GRU

## Overview
This project focuses on traffic prediction using Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models and vehicle detection. The goal is to analyze traffic patterns at different junctions in Bengaluru, forecast future traffic flow using time series analysis, and detect vehicles from traffic footage.

## Features
- **Time Series Forecasting**: Predict traffic congestion at major junctions.
- **GRU Model Implementation**: Utilizes GRU networks for efficient sequential data processing.
- **Vehicle Detection**: Detects and counts vehicles using computer vision techniques.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and normalizes traffic data for better predictions.
- **Model Training & Evaluation**: Trained GRU models with various hyperparameters and compared predictions against test sets.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of traffic patterns and model performance.

## Dataset
The dataset contains traffic data collected from multiple junctions in Bengaluru, including:
- Timestamped vehicle counts
- Traffic density
- Weather conditions (if applicable)
- Video footage for vehicle detection

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shreyachakote2004/traffic-prediction-gru.git
cd traffic-prediction-gru

```

## Usage
### 1. Data Preprocessing


### 2. Train GRU Model


### 3. Evaluate Model


### 4. Vehicle Detection


### 5. Visualize Predictions


## Results
- The trained GRU model effectively predicts traffic patterns.
- The model performance is evaluated using RMSE and MAE.
- Vehicle detection successfully identifies and counts vehicles in real-time.
- Comparisons with actual traffic data show promising results.
